Drag-and-Drop Canvas– Build a position by dragging option blocks onto the board. Strikes are picked point-by-point on an intuitive slider, so even first-timers can “stack” strategies in seconds.\n2. On-/Off-Chain Data Fusion – Each block merges live on-chain metrics from Solana (implied volatility, liquidity, open interest) with off-chain feeds—order-book depth, macro headlines, sentiment scores—so traders see the full picture in one place.\n3. AI Risk Buddy– Lightweight time-series models forecast price paths and translate greeks into plain English tips (“≈75 % chance to reach 3× payoff; suggest +1 protective put”).\n4. One-Swipe Settlement – Review, sign, and settle on-chain with a single swipe. Every trade awards XP and unlocks fee discounts, keeping the learning loop fun and rewarding.\n                      |\n\nBy removing complexity and adding real-time guidance, FunOption lowers the barrier for millions of crypto traders who want effective hedging without the typical options headache.\n",

      "description": "Problem:\nDEX trading today charges 0.25–5% in fees on every trade — then just adds that money back into liquidity pools. On Solana alone, over $1.4B has been locked into liq.pools of tokens that didn’t survive 2 hours. But those fees could’ve been redistributed differently — creating incentive for holders to stay, without placing additional costs on traders\n\nSolution:\nCoolDEX is the first-ever DEX that auto-distributes fees to real-time holders of the traded token — with no staking, no locking, and no dev-side control. Just hold = get rewarded.\n\nFor the first time in Web3, trading volume directly benefits the community behind the token — not just LPs.\n\nRight now, only flippers win. \nWith our tech, projects gain a base of loyal holders — reducing sell pressure and giving traders more confidence to play.\nBoth sides win. No value extraction.\n\nCEO - t.me/LEOresearch",

Everyone pays DEX fees.\n\nBut none of those fees reward you.\nNot your community. Not other holders.\nThey just get added back to the LP — or go to people staking a completely different launchpad token.\n\nYou contribute. You hold.\nBut you get nothing back.\n\nFair? We don’t think so.\n\nSo we built CoolDEX — the first-ever DEX where trading fees can go to real-time holders of the token being traded, not just LPs.\nNo staking. No locking. No dev control.\nJust automated distribution after every trade — fully on-chain, built on SPL.\nJust hold tokens in any wallet (like Phantom), and get rewarded.\n\nHow it works:\nTokens launch via Somethingcool, where creators configure how the DEX fee splits: real-time holders, LPs, burn — in any ratio. After the bonding curve, liquidity migrates to CoolDEX, and fee distribution activates automatically.\n\nWe’re not just building a new DEX.\nWe’re rewriting the incentive structure behind DEX trading.\n\n📎 Docs: https://docs.something.cool/\n🎥 1-min explainer: https://x.com/somethingco_ol/status/1882461562507829362\n👤 CEO: t.me/LEOresearch\n\nCommunity co-ownership projects and PVE aren’t just ideas anymore — we made them real.\nFirst time in Web3.\nExclusively on Solana.\n",

This was done in late Q4 just after our mint and was then put on the back-burner.\n\nHowever, using the Colosseum as our motivation over the last two months we have spun that simple demo experience into a full game. Over 80% of the work for this game, and almost all core features have been designed and built in the Colosseum period.\n\nIn particular, during this period we built: a soulbound NFT system, a wardrobe, a log system, and four out of five of the core chapters of the game. In essence, we've taken the game from concept to end-product at breakneck pace. We've told a complete story with our IP and we hope you enjoy it!",

Classified as utility tokens within the European Economic Area (EEA), they can be traded under the same regulatory framework as other standard crypto assets.\n\nHolo will bring the following benefits:\n- No KYC or AML requirements \n- Diversified asset exposure within a single, permissionless DeFi ecosystem\n- Buy stocks without having to sell your crypto\n- Borrow against your synthetics \n- Tap into a new era of low-impermanent-loss liquidity mining\n- Open a new vertical for arbitrage trading between DEX and traditional finance\n- Integrate a new asset class to drive DeFi innovation\n",

Over the coming weeks, leading up to the conclusion of the Hackathon, we’ll continue preparing for this transition and begin exploring significant new concepts, such as the implementation of concentrated liquidity. That said, these updates involve in-depth theoretical work and scoping, which cannot be completed immediately and won’t be reflected in the GitHub repository over the next weeks. \n\nIf you’d like to follow our progress in the coming weeks, we’d be happy to get in touch!",
